I started to learn python language.
Since I already know C++ a little bit I began with data structures.

I decided that it is good idea to write my application while I read
the python book and since my second wish is prepare yourself to english
speaking job on the next few years - this is will be vocabulary application.
Throughout my reading the book I will impove this app.

And I need to invent the optimazed way to learn english language.
